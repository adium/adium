 *
 * NSMutableCharacterSet's documentation states that immutable NSCharacterSets are more efficient than NSMutableCharacterSets.
 * Shark sampling demonstrates this to be true as of OS X 10.4.5.
 *
 * However, -[NSMutableCharacterSet copy] returns a new NSMutableCharacterSet which remains inefficient!
 *
 * This is still true as of 10.7.2.
