 * @class AIMutableOwnerArray
 * @brief An container object that keeps track of who owns each of its objects.
 *
 * Every object in the \c AIMutableOwnerArray has an associated owner.  The best use for this class is when 
 * multiple pieces of code may be trying to control the same thing.  For instance, if there are several events that can
 * cause something to change colors, by using an owner-array it is possible to prevent conflicts and determine an
 * average color based on all the values.  It's also easy for a specific owner to remove the value they contributed,
 * or replace it with another.
 *
 * An owner can only own one object in a given \c AIMutableOwnerArray.
 *
 * Floating point priority levels can be used to dictate the ordering of objects in the array.
 * Lower numbers have higher priority.
