 * @brief An NSOutlineView subclass with several improvments
 *
 * <p>This <tt>NSOutlineView</tt> subclass has several improvements and serves as the base class for the other outline view subclasses in the AIUtilities framework.</p>
 * <p>It supports contextual menu, expanded state, deletion, and dragging-ended notification methods for its delegate (see the <tt>AIOutlineViewDelegate</tt> protocol description for details).</p>
 * <p>It posts AIOutlineViewUserDidExpandItemNotification and AIOutlineViewUserDidCollapseItemNotification to the default NSNotificationCenter when items expand and collapse, respectively; for these notifications, the object is the <tt>AIOutlineView</tt> and the userInfo is an NSDictionary with the changed item in the key @"Object".
 * <p>It supports improved keyboard navigation of the outline view, including supporting the delete key.</p>
 * <p>It adds the use of tab and backtab to cycle through matches when using KFTypeSelectTableView</p>
 * <p>Finally, it fixes a crash when reloadData is called from 'outlineView:setObjectValue:forTableColumn:byItem:' while the last row is edited in a way that will reduce the number of rows in the outline view (crash fix is relevant on all system versions as of OS X 10.3.7).</p>
