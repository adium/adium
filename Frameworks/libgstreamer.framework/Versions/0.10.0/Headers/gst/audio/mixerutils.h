/**
 * GstAudioMixerFilterFunc:
 * @mixer: a #GstElement implementing the #GstMixer interface
 * @user_data: user data
 *
 * Function that will be called by gst_audio_default_registry_mixer_filter()
 * so the caller can decide which mixer elements should be kept and returned.
 * When the mixer element is passed to the callback function, it is opened
 * and in READY state. If you decide to keep the element, you need to set it
 * back to NULL state yourself (unless you want to keep it opened of course).
 *
 * Returns: TRUE if the element should be kept, FALSE otherwise.
