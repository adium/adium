New in 0.10.7:

* Nothing really.  Just to fix my mess with 0.10.6 release (that never left
  the door.)

New in 0.10.6:

* Fixed type sizes when stdint.h is not available.

New in 0.10.5:

* Unicode 4.1.0 character database used.

* Fixed type sizes on 64-bit architectures.

* We've become GNU FriBidi.  Note capitalization please.

* We have moved to http://fribidi.org/, hosted on freedesktop.org.

New in 0.10.4:

* Unicode 3.2 data files used.

New in 0.10.2:

* Rule L3 of UAX#9 implemented.  Now fribidi implements the whole Unicode
  BiDi Algorithm.

* The autogenerated table files now contain much fewer symbols, which reduces
  the relocation time of the library.

New in 0.10.1:

* fribidi.spec has been added to distribution, please use this file if you
  are going to create an RPM package from fribidi.

* Fribidi tested on sourceforge.net's compile farm.
  Currently tested and has no problem with:
