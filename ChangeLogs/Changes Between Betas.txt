Adium 1.4b6
 * Added throttling to Growl messages. Instead of, for example, posting 296 messages, Adium will Growl "296 messages". (#12133)
 * Added an "only count number of unread mentions" for group chat tabs in the Messages advanced preferences. (#12033)
 * Separated group chat and regular chat preferences in the Messages advanced preferences.
 * Disabled Zephyr. As an unsupported protocol, we require patches to maintain it in working order. At this point in time, it just crashes.
 * Changed image upload behaviorâ€”it will now upload the smaller of a JPG or a PNG representation of the image. Images will be sized down if they exceed the service's maximum size. (2.5MB for pic.im)
 * Fixed using a PAC-specified proxy for the hostname of the account. (#224)
 * Fixed the status of an IRC contact after they've left all the channels they have in common with you.
 * Fixed a hang when a message contains a message used for message styles.
Updated Libpurple
 * Fixed connecting to Yahoo! behind a proxy server. (#12231)
 * Message styles can now be updated without relaunching Adium
