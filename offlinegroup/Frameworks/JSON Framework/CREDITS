    A lot of the inspiration to early versions of this framework
    came from Blake's BSJSONAdditions project.

Marc Lehmann
    Part of the inspiration for my JSON work has been from Marc's
    JSON::XS Perl module. I also adopted the way he organised the
    tests. Having a separate fixture for testing error conditions
    makes a lot of sense.

    Jens emailed me out of the blue one day with a couple of patches
    that gave a speedup of 11x for generation and 5x for parsing of
    the long (12k) JSON string I've been using for testing.

Greg Bolsinga
    Provided patches for dropping the dependency on AppKit and thus
    truly making this a Foundation framework, and for building a
    static library suitable for use with the iPhone.
