This is GNU FriBidi,
a Free Implementation of the Unicode BiDirectional algorithm.

Background
==========
One of the missing links stopping the penetration of free software in Middle
East is the lack of support for the Arabic and Hebrew alphabets. In order to
have proper Arabic and Hebrew support, the BiDi algorithm should have been
implemented. It is our hope that this library will stimulate more free
software in the Middle Eastern countries.

Audience
========
It is our hope that this library will stimulate the implementation of Hebrew
and Arabic in lots of free software. Here is a small list of projects that
would benifit from the use of the GNU FriBidi library, but of course there are
many more: Wine, Mozilla, Qt, KDE, lynx, OpenOffice.

It may be interesting for you to know that Fribidi is already being used in
projects like Gnome, GTK+, Pango, AbiWord, and Xterm.

Implementation
==============
The library implements the algorithm described in the "Unicode Standard
Annex #9, The Bidirectional Algorithm", available at
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/. GNU FriBidi has been tested
exhaustively against the Unicode Reference Code, and due to our knowledge,
it completely conforms to the specification, always producing the same
result as the Reference Code.

The reordering of characters is done through the function:
      
     void
     fribidi_log2vis(/* input */
		     FriBidiChar *str,
		     int len,
		     FriBidiCharType *pbase_dir,
		     /* output */
		     FriBidiChar *visual_str,
		     gint        *position_L_to_V_list,
		     gint        *position_V_to_L_list,
		     gint8       *embedding_level_list
		     )
    

where
     str                    is the Unicode input string
     len                    is the length of the unicode string
     pbase_dir              is the input and output base direction. If 
                            base == FRIBIDI_TYPE_ON then fribidi_log2vis 
                            calculates the base direction on its own
                            according to the BiDi algorithm.
     visual_str             The reordered output unicode string.
     position_L_to_V_list   Maps the positions in the logical string to 
                            positions in the visual string.
     position_V_to_L_list   Maps the positions in the visual string to 
                            the positions in the logical string.
     embedding_level_list   Returns the classification of each character. Even
                            levels indicate LTR characters, and odd levels
                            indicate RTL characters. The main use of this
                            list is in interactive applications when the
                            embedding e.g. level determines cursor display.

If any of the output pointers == NULL, then that information is not 
calculated.  Note that this function does not allow line breaking, and
so GNU FriBidi is not feature complete yet.  This will be fixed in the
future.

How it looks like
=================

Have a look at tests directory, to see some input and outputs, which
CapRTL charset means that CAPITAL letters are right to left, and digits
6, 7, 8, 9 are Arabic digits, try 'fribidi --charsetdesc CapRTL' for the
full description.

Executable
==========

There is also a command line utilitity called `fribidi' that loops over
the text of a file and performs the BiDi algorithm on each line, also
used for testing the algorithm. Run fribidi with the --help option to
learn about usage.
