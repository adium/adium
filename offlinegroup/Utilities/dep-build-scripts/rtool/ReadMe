*About rtool script*

rtool helps to relocate a library as a NeXT/ GNUStep/ Apple Mac OS X
Framework bundle. rtool is an "Automator" to relocate a library into a
bundle without rebuilding it (including options for other linked Libraries
and linked Executables).

*What means rtool ?* Do Not Touch your Makefile or build scripts.

    * Relocate libFoo.dylib to Foo.framework ?
    * Relocate libFoo.dylib to Foo.framework and its dependencies ?
    * Relocate libFoo.dylib to Foo.framework with a relative path ?
    * Building My Bundle.app with included Frameworks ?

    * My libFoo.dylib uses a static sharedir ?
      sharedir to Resources dir (relative path, identifier, CoreFoundation)
      - Resources/Examples/share
      - Resources/Examples/rpath
      - Resources/DawinBox
      Hacking quickly the libFoo source, build and relocate it after.

*Anatomy of a Modern Bundle*

The basic structure of a modern bundle is very simple. At the top-level
of the bundle there is a directory named Contents. This directory
contains everything, including the resources, executable code, private
frameworks, private plug-ins, and support files needed by the
application or plug-in. While the Contents directory might seem
superfluous, it identifies the bundle as a modern-style bundle and
separates it from document and legacy bundle types.
