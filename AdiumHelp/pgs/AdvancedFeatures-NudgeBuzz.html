			<p>Adium calls it simply “notification”, and enables you to send and receive it.</p>
			<p>The same information on this page is also presented in <a href="http://adium.im/screencasts/?video=5">an Adium screencast</a> on our website, which shows the feature in action.</p>
			<p><strong>Presenting notifications you receive</strong></p>
			<p>When somebody nudges you, the official clients will shake the window and play a sound.</p>
			<p>We don't offer the window-shaking action, but we do provide our entire usual suite of event actions. You see, receiving a notification is in Adium as one of the events in the Preferences. You determine what Adium will do when one comes in.</p>
			<p>In the <strong>Events</strong> pane of Adium's Preferences simply select the “Notification received” event in the list, click the <strong>+</strong> button, and choose the action you want Adium to perform. You can add as many actions as you want.</p>
			<p><strong>Sending notifications</strong></p>
			<p>There are three ways to send a notification to one of your contacts:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The keyboard: Type “/nudge” into the inputline and press Return or Enter.</li>
					<li>The menu: Choose “Send Notification” from the Contact menu.</li>
					<li>The toolbar: The “Send Notification” button is not on the chat window toolbar by default, so you need to add it.
						<ul>
							<li>First, right-click on the chat window toolbar and choose “Customize Toolbar…”.</li>
							<li>Drag the “Send Notification” button to the toolbar. Finally, click OK. From then on, when you want to send a notification, click “Send Notification” (or the shaking-emoticon icon if you're using Icon Only mode).</li>
