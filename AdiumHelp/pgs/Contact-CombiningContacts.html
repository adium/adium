This is extremely useful when one of your contacts has multiple user names or a user name on multiple services.			</p>			<p>				For instance, if you have the following user names on your contact list:			</p>			<ul>				<li>adiumuser				</li>				<li>adiumuser@hotmail.com				</li>				<li>adiumuser34				</li>			</ul>			<p>				all belonging to the same individual, you can combine them into a single entry so that all you see is:			</p>			<ul>				<li>Adium User				</li>			</ul>			<p>				The result is smaller, easier to manage contact list.  This combined contact will also be respected in the Chat Transcripts viewer.			</p>			<table class="dots" width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="One column table with heading">				<tr>					<td class="blue" colspan="2">						<h3>							Combining Contacts						</h3>					</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td valign="top">						<p>							To combine two or more contacts, simply drag one onto the other.

When the chat opens, you will see a bar at the top of the message window which allows you to choose which name you want to message. Adium will automatically pick the name you messaged last; if this is still correct, simply send as normal and the bar will disappear after your first message.</p>														<p>Once a message window is open with a contact, you can alternatively click on the Source/Destination option in the toolbar (if the toolbar is active - the default set of toolbar buttons includes the Source/Destination button). When you click on the Source/Destination option, the bar at the top of the message window will open so you can choose which name you to send a message to or from.						</p>						<p>							You can specify the priority of the contained contacts by reordering them in the <strong>Contact List</strong> while the Contact Inspector is open. Higher in the list is higher priority; higher priority indicates such things as which contact's away message will be shown in the contact list and tooltips if differing away messages are set for the individual contacts.						</p>					</td>				</tr>			</table><br />		</div>	</body></html>
