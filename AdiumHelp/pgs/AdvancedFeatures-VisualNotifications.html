		<h1>Visual notifications</h1>
	</div>
	<p>Visual notifications are a means of unobtrusively informing you when things happen, for example when you receive a message. In their default configuration, they fade into the top-right corner of your screen for a moment and then fade out again.</p>
	<p>Adium features comprehensive support for visual notifications by ways of OS X's very own <a class="ext_link" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5362">Notification Center</a> (on OS X 10.8 and later), third-party software <a class="ext_link" href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> as well as built-in notifications called "Mist" (on OS 10.7 and older).</p>
	<p>This page explains the three different notification mechanisms mentioned above. See <a href="AdvancedFeatures-Events.html">Events</a> on how to tell Adium when to display visual notifications.<p>

			<p>The third-party application Growl.app has been around about as long as Adium itself â€“ a long time before Apple introduced "Notification Center" (NC) in OS X 10.8 ("Mountain Lion").</p>
			<p>While Growl.app is the obvious solution for users on previous versions of OS X, it also has a lot to offer to OS X users on 10.8, especially in the way of customisability and extendability. For example, there are dozens of different styles to choose from.</p>
			<p>To install Growl.app either <a class="ext_link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12">buy the application from the Mac App Store</a>, or get an older and free version from <a class="ext_link" href="http://growl.info/downloads">http://growl.info/downloads</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have Growl.app installed and would prefer to use Notification Center notifications for Adium, you need make the change in Growl's preferences.</p>
			<p>To uninstall the Growl application, follow the <a class="ext_link" href="http://growl.info/documentation/growl-package-removal.php">instructions on the Growl website</a>.</p>

			<h3>Built-in notifications ("Mist", OS X 10.7 and older)</h3>
		</div>
		<p align="center"> <img src="../gfx/MistNotification.png" alt="" /></p>
		<div class="taskboxtext">
			<p>As of Adium 1.5, Adium is able to show Growl-style notifications on OS X versions 10.7 and 10.6 without the Growl application installed. This feature is called <a class="ext_link" href="http://growl.info/notetodevelopers">Mist</a>.</p>
			<p>If you want to use a different style or use some of the more advanced features of Growl, you will have to either <a class="ext_link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12">buy the application from the Mac App Store</a>, or get an older and free version from <a class="ext_link" href="http://growl.info/downloads">http://growl.info/downloads</a>.</p>
			<p>To disable Mist notifications, enter this command in Terminal.app: <code>defaults write -g com.growl.growlframework.mist.enabled -bool NO</code>. Please note that this affects any apps that support built-in Mist notifications like Adium does.<p>
