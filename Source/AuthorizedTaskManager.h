// AuthorizedTaskManager mirrors an NSFileManager method,
// but uses NSTask or AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to invoke
// tools to do the job.  This allows us to be using the same tools 
// regardless of whether the operation is authenticated with admin privs or not.
// The differences between the auth and the non-auth code path is thus
// minimized.
//
// Note that despite the similar names to NSFileManager methods,
// this method observes the semantics of its underlying tool (ditto)
//
// USAGE NOTE: when running the task with admin privileges, this waits on any  
// child process, since AEWP doesn't tell us the child's pid.  This could be  
// fooled by any other child process that quits in the window between launch and 
// completion of our actual tool.  The effect could be harmless, it could be a
// lack of synchronicity, or it could be an incorrect result for the 
// move/copy/etc operation.  See method runTaskForPath:withArguments:
//
// BUILD NOTE: link to Security.framework
