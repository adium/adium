 * @brief Update after the clip view scrolls
 *
 * This is needed because our scroll view overlaps the bottom-right resize widget in the standard contact list window and has a small scroller.
 * The window draws the resize widget, which leaves behind white artifacts in the area that a large scroller would be but a small one is not.
 *
 * If we added a bar to the bottom of the standard window, this could go away.
